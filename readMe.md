This is the H2Search Engine.

This is the most bare bones from the repo, you will have to take the zip file and dump all the files contained in there
into where all the code is stored.

Then you just need to run main.py to have the website up and running.

For crawling you will just want to go to crawler3.py and run it. Be sure to disable the loading of file from disk
if starting fresh for crawling.

One crawled, you can then run the other functions, this is the order you should run it in:
optimizeVisted.py
pageRankv2.py
convertScores.py
whooshCode.py

Now you should be ready to lauch the website.
